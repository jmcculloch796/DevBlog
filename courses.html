            <div class="panel-body"><h5>Big Data Management</h5>
                <p><i> Mark Awarded: N/A </i>
                <p> Within this course, I will be learning different database models, and structures. For the first three years of university, there has been a large emphasis on MySQL and relational database systems, but within this course the focus
                    is on NoSQL systems, specifically MongoDB. The first part of coursework for this is to export data from MySQL into a JSON schema and then enter this schema into MongoDB. The coursework spec is available <a href="coursework/bigdata.pdf">here.</a> My report for this part of the coursework is available to read from <a href="Reports/F21BDR1.pdf">here.</a>
                    <br>
                    For the second part of this course, the focus was on the Semantic Web, and the technology used to link data together. I have learned about RDF, OWL, and SPARQL. The <a href="coursework/F21BDCW2">coursework spec </a>for this part was to write a report on Semantic Web technologies. My completed report is available <a href="Reports/F21BDR2">from here. </a>Once I retrieve the grades for these, I will update here. </p>
                <h5> e-Commerce Technology </h5>
                <p><i> Mark Awarded: N/A </i>
                <p> This course examines the uprising of e-Commerce (conducting business through the internet) and how business habits have changed with technology. I'm intruiged in this aspect of computer science as it is constantly evolving
                    and changing with the times. There is no set criteria to learn - it changes too often. </div> </p>

                <p><i> Mark Awarded: N/A </i>
                <p> As part of the MEng course, this course is multidiscipline -  encompassing software, mechanical, electrical, and chemical engineering. It is designed to teach
                    the 'soft' skills in industry - such as giving presentations, writing reports, and teamwork. As part of this course, I am a supervisor for a 3rd year mechanical engineering group project. While
                    challenging, this has show me how to work alongside another discipline and to work on my leadership skills. </p>
                <h5> Research Methods and Implementation </h5>
                <p><i> Mark Awarded: 75% </i>
                <p> This course focuses on the <a href="diss.html">4th year dissertation</a>, and how to write it effectively. It contains guest lectures from different areas of Heriot Watt, including Computer Science, the library, the careers service,
                    and student support. </p>
                <h5>Data Visualisation and Analytics </h5>
                <p><i> Mark Awarded: 32% </i>
                <p> This course focuses on the d3.js library. The coursework for this involves using the REF2014 dataset for universities all over the UK, to display this data in an interesting, unique, and exciting away. Once this has been
                    completed, I will link it here. </p>
                <h5>Data Mining and Machine Learning </h5>
                <p><i> Mark Awarded: 63% </i>
                <p>In this course, I am finding out about data mining and machine learning techniques by using <a href="https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/"> Weka</a>. Specifically different tree classifiers for searching through data, including J48, and RandomTree. I also learned about
                    neural networks, through MultilayerPerceptron. The coursework involved receiving a large dataset and using various algorithms to see which is the best in terms of correctly classifying instances within the dataset. The coursework reports and spec are listed below:

                <p><i> Mark Awarded: 43% </i>
                <p> This furthered the knowledge learned in Foundations 1 in semester 1 of year 3, but focused more on the mathematical definition of a 'function', set theory, and Cantor's diagonalisation. We also learned about Godel Numbering, enumeration functions, and turing machines and how to represent them. </p>
                <h5> Language Processors </h5>
                <p><i> Mark Awarded: 50% </i>
                <p> This course taught us of formal grammars - and the three types of them. We also dealt with Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) and Non-deterministic Finite Automate (NFA), and how to draw them. During the second half of the course we learned about compilers and how they used a form of grammar to
                    enforce rules. We were then tasked with creating a new language called FUNC and to ensure that it followed the correct syntax rules. <a href = "coursework/lp.pdf"> The coursework spec is available here.</a>
                <h5>Operating Systems and Concurrency</h5>
                <p><i> Mark Awarded: 50% </i>
                <p> There was a focus on memory management, mallocs, file systems, pipelining, data-flow, and data parallelism, among others. We were given a weekly lab task and had a week to complete it and get this marked off in the lab for a certain percentage. </p>
                <h5>Professional Development</h5>
                <p><i> Mark Awarded: 77% </i>
                <p>This course focussed a lot more on the legal side of working, and ensuring that you act professional in the workplace. WIthin this course there was a section on ethics, laws (like the Data Protection Act), and standards, This course was paired with Software Engineering from semester 1  of year 3 and included the group project. We also
                    had to do a presentation on a random topic and where given a position (for or against) and made to argue it. My group was tasked with the Volkswagen emissions scandal where we were the whistleblower and had to argue for blowing the whistle on this issue. </p>

                <p><i> Mark Awarded: 78% </i>
                <p> This course introduced me to a lot of new and innovating concepts within the world of Artificial Intelligence. What intruiges
                    me most about this area of computing science is that it is relatively new and untouched, leaving a lot up for discussion and debate. Within
                    this course there was a focus upon the different types of agent: be it learning, biological, or planning. The coursework for this course was to
                    use the A* search to guide robots to a certain goal within a grid. There is a link to the github repository <a href="https://github.com/jmcculloch796/robotplanner"> here</a>.
                    I also was introduced to PDDL, which is a planning environment in which I simulated situations in which a robot would be in and how it would solve this issues within the specific
                    domain given in the question. </p>
                <h5> Data Communications and Networking </h5>
                <p><i> Mark Awarded: 33% </i>
                <p> This course focuses on how networks work, different types of network. It also delved into different techniques to solve common issues within networking, including
                    different protocols to ensure file transfer integrity such as StopWait which waited for ackknowledgement that the recipient received correctly before sending another packet over the network.   </p>
                <h5>Foundations 1 </h5>
                <p><i> Mark Awarded: 70% </i>
                <p> This course taught the lambda calculus, which is a formal mathematical system to define logic. I learned alpha, beta, and eta reduction logic, along with the history of the lambda calculus. The coursework involved
                    translating from one form of logic to another.</p>
                <h5>Software Engineering</h5>
                <p><i> Mark Awarded: 77% </i>
                <p>This course was mostly focused on the <a href="projects.html#target">  3rd year group project</a> and included a Q&A session with Leidos, who we were tasked with creating software for. It also introduced the idea of Agile development, SCRUM analysis, risk analysis and usability studies</p>
