    <h3>Time2Dine</h3>

    <p>Since May I have been working at <a href="https://www.time2dine.uk/#/">Time2Dine</a> as a software engineer. Time2Dine is an ambitious startup based in Glasgow. The goal of Time2Dine is to allow people to enjoy
        restaurant food more efficiently and conveniently by letting them order and pay for their food in advance, then they just have to show up and they're food will be ready and waiting for them.
        This has been a very challenging but rewarding experience. Having only ever worked in retail and hospitality, working in an office environment was very different, and took a bit of getting used to.
        With it being a startup, there are only a few people working for the company, and this has meant that from the start I have had a lot of responsibility. This has been the most challenging
        aspect of the internship but I feel I have finally settled in and I am in a position to now not only complete my tasks, but also help my colleagues with theirs. <br> <br>
        I have been using the <a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel</a> PHP framework, which is an excellent extension to PHP. I have enjoyed using Laravel and find it a very useful tool, so much so that it
        is how I am hosting my blog now. Though university taught me a lot about web development and some PHP, it did not delve into any frameworks, so this was a brand new experience for me, but one that I feel will be
        very useful for me in my career. I also have been using <a href="https://vuejs.org/">VueJS</a> to ensure the POS is as fluid and reactive as possible. I have really enjoyed using VueJS, and it is very easy to integrate
        with Laravel. It allows me to auto update the orders page for the POS by pulling data from an API endpoint, without refreshing the page. Another part of my job is to protect the API
        endpoints that I am retrieving data from. I am using OAuth2 authentication to protect the endpoint routes. I am generating a token by sending valid login details to the system, and this Bearer Token is then
        sent as a header to the endpoint. The endpoint then checks to see if the token exists in the database, and if it is attributed to the user that is trying to access it. <br> <br>
        I have learned a lot through this placement, it is one thing to do courseworks and projects within university, but it is another to complete projects that will be used in real life and by real people. It is a massive
        responsibility but one that I have come to relish and enjoy.
