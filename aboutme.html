  <h2> Aspiring Software Engineer </h2>
<h3> About Me </h3>
<p> Hi, my name is Jamie McCulloch, and I am a fourth year student at <a href="https://www.hw.ac.uk/"> Heriot Watt University.</a> I am currently studying a Masters in Software Engineering with the intention
  of graduating in 2019. Ever since I was a child, my dad would show me how to fix computers, set up printers, and fix the router (by which he meant turn it off and on
  again). However in the classic way - the student became the teacher - and now he comes to me for help! I grew up knowing I wanted to do something
  with computers, and when I was in high school and wrote my first Visual Basic "Hello World" program in 4th year high school, I knew I wanted to code. <br> <br>
  Now in my fourth year I have worked on a lot of projects within university (see here: <a href="projects.html"> projects</a>) ranging from
  a currency converter Android application to using an A* search algorithm for robots to find their goals. While university has most definitely been challenging, I
  still have the same passion for computing and technology as I did when I changed the ink in a printer for the first time.
<br> <br>
I currently work part time as a bartender in a local bowling alley/golf course, and have done for the last year and a half. However with my time at university diminishing
I am currently looking for summer internships for 2018. Also as part of my MEng course, I must undertake a placement for semester 1 of year 5 (September 2018) and do a project and write up
based on this. 
<h4> My online CV is <a href="cv.html"> available here </a>if you would like to take a look. </h4> <br><br>
For any enquiries my academic email is jm7@hw(dot)ac(dot)uk, I aim to be as responsive on this as possible and should reply within a few hours at most.
