<h3> Resources </h3>
<p> Within my time at university, I have discovered many different resources to help me through my courses, and to expand my knowledge within the field. My favourites are listed below: </p>

<h4> Sublime Text Editor </h4>
<p> This text editor is definitely one of my favourites, from its sleek look to its auto closing of brackets/tags it makes coding much easier for me. It is <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/"> available here. </a>

<h4> TheCodingTrain </h4>
<p> After only discovering this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman"> YouTube channel </a> recently is has become one of my favourites, with the videos being entertaining and educational, especially the coding challenges. Although mostly focusing on JavaScript, specifically p5, his enthusiasm and passion for coding shines through. The ideas behind the tasks are fundamentally the same for any programming language and I feel as though these videos help with my understanding of certain tasks.  </p>

<h4> Eclipse </h4>
<p> Using <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/ide/"> this IDE </a> through most of university, it is very sleek and informative. With its many extensions to cater for other libraries it is very useful when coding. Although I have not used eclipse in a while it still remains a favourite and I am sure I will revisit it at some point. </p>

<h4> Android Studio </h4>
<p> Creating the android application for my <a href="diss.html">dissertation</a> has been a lot more fluid and easy through using <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html">Android Studio.</a> It makes it easier to layout and link my app and has built in emulators to help with running the app on my laptop. </p>

<h4> GitHub </h4>
<p> Hands down one of the most important tools I have used during university, especially during group projects, this allows for file sharing and editing. It is an exceptional tool and means my group could all work seperately and just upload what they had done, and for the most part this worked perfectly. My <a href="https://github.com/jmcculloch796">github repository</a> is available to view, and I will add more to it including my dissertation application. </p>
