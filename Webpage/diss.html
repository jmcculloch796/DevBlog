<h3> Dissertation </h3>
<p> For my 4th year dissertation I have decided to investigate the effectiveness of personal safety applications on smartphones. With the rising popularity of smartphones, and
  the consistently present threat of crime, there is a gap in the market for personal safety applications. Basically everyone has a phone nowadays, and
  with this comes the ability to contact anyone at any time, instantly record video and audio, and location tracking. All of these have the ability
  to reassure people that they are safer, feel more in control.
   <br>  First I will look into
  what kind of research has already been done in terms of this, and then gather all of this and apply it to my own study. I then plan to design an app
  that will take the best features from already existing apps, such as location tracker or panic buttons, but also some of my own original ideas. These will
  hopefully include an anonymous proximity-based forum, much like yik yak, among others. <br>
  I will be updating this page with app designs and thoughts, as well as my blog on the homepage. Wish me luck! <br>


  <h3> First Deliverable </h3>

<p>  The first deliverable for my dissertation is now available <a href="Dissertation_D1.pdf"> here </a>, it details the research behind personal safety applications and society's opinion on them. I was awarded 75% for this deliverable
  and hope to maintain this going into second semester. </p>
