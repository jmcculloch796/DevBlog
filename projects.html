<h3> Past and Present Projects</h3>
<h4> Ongoing Projects <h3>
  <h5> Big Data Management </h5>
  <p> For Big Data Management course in Year 4 Semester 2, we have a table of flight routes in MySQL. Our task is to create a JSON schema to hold this data, and export it to a NoSQL data store. I have chosen to work with
    MongoDB. The coursework spec can be found <a href="coursework/bigdata.pdf"> here. </a>
  <h5> Dissertation </h5>
  <p> For my 4th year Dissertation, I am researching the effectiveness of personal safety applications on smartphones, with the intention of creating my own personal safety application for Android. More
    details of this can be found <a href="diss.html"> here</a>.<br><br>

    <div class="panel-body"> As part of Professional and Industrial Studies, which is comprised of Software Engineers, Mechanical Engineers, Chemical Engineers, and Electrical Engineers, I am in a group of
      3 who have been tasked with supervising a 3rd year mechanical engineering project. Their task is to use digital means to improve the lives of people living in Kenya, and it is part of
      the 'Engineering Without Borders' initiative. This will allow me to improve my leadership skills, and to gain insight into industry and how to lead a project.</div>

    <div id="collapse4" class="panel-collapse collapse">
    <div class="panel-body"> During a group project, we were tasked with designing a resource allocation system for a billion
    dollar American defence company that allowed the firm to manage its employees and the projects
    they are currently contributing to. Working in a group of 6, this was a year long project where we
    designed a company from scratch, and retail our system to the company during an expo event within
    the university. We followed a Gantt chart, attended weekly meetings, and used multiple langauges
    such as MySQL, JavaScript, HTML5, and PHP to complete this project.

    <div id="collapse1" class="panel-collapse collapse">
      <div class="panel-body"> In third year, Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Agents, working in pairs, we were to use the A* search algorithm to guide multiple robots to their own specific goals
        without colliding with each other. It took into account the shortest path, but if this was not possible due to collision, then the program would recognise this and either reroute the robot
        or work out if it is better just to stall for a move until the other robot is out of the way. This project is linked on my GitHub account which is at the bottom of each page. We got an A in this coursework
        and it is my most enjoyable project within university yet. The link to the GitHub repository is <a href="https://github.com/jmcculloch796/robotplanner"> here. </a></div>

    <div id="collapse2" class="panel-collapse collapse">
    <div class="panel-body">  My first proper group project was in Database Management Systems, in year 2. Working in a group of 5, we were to create a database system for a delivery company to manage customers and their
     packages. Multiple tables were used in this database, including a Customer table, an Order table, a Vehicle table, and an Employee table. All of these were related to each other
     and complex sql queries used to extract data from each table. As stated, we started with 5 people however due to unforseen circumstances, one member ended up dropping out and so we had to improvise
     and pick up the slack. Despite this we ended up doing very well and achieving an A.</div>

    <div class="panel-body">  In Software Design, during 2nd year, in pairs, we were tasked with creating a design for a fictional shoe shop called Kerr and Brown. We were expected to design a website, and also
      create multiple diagrams to fully investigate the full design. These included a Use Case diagram, a State Machine diagram, and a Deployment diagram. This showed be another
      side to developing software. There was no emphasis on coding for this task, it was purely design skills. This was a nice change of pace compared to all the other
      code-heavy modules of second year.</div>

    <div class="panel-body">  Within the Interactive Systems module in 1st year, I created two Android applications - an air hockey simulator made using AppInventor, and a currency converter coded in
      Java. This was an individual project and I achieved an A for these apps and the course overall. It was a great learning experience, as we were thrown in at the deep end
      and expected to find out everything for ourselves. Coming from a school environment that was very teacher-dependent, it was nice to be set free and solve problems through
      my own means - mainly stack overflow... </div>
