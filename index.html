  <h4> Exam Results </h4>
  <p><i> Date posted: 31/01/2018 </i> <br> <br> 
  I have now received my exam results for semester 1 of year 4. I achieved an A for my <a href="Dissertation_D1.pdf">first deliverable of my dissertation </a>(downloads .pdf file) and two B's in Data Mining and Machine Learning (62%) and Professional and Industrial Studies (65%). More details on these courses <a href="courses.html"> here</a>. However I am dissapointed in my grade for Data Visualisation (32%) as I prioritised other courses and dissertation over this which resulted in a much lower grade. Overall, I am happy with these results, as this was my first true challenge concerning time management within my time at university. </p>
  <h4> Week 3 of Semester 2 </h4>
    <p> <i> Date posted: 24/01/2018 </i> <br> <br>
      With the second semester of university already flying by, I have been creating some smaller android apps to get me back into the swing of things again. Once completed these will be available <a href="apps.html"> here </a> or through the projects page on the toolbar.
      <br> <br>
      Two of the courses I am sitting this semester are E-Commerce Technology and Big Data Management, both of which I am finding very interesting. Through Big Data Management I am learning to use mongoDB, and applying JSON hierarchies which I am finding enjoyable. 
  <h4> Back to uni update and dissertation result </h4>
  <p>  <i>Date posted: 12/01/18</i> <br> <br>
 Back to uni after christmas break, and I am raring to get stuck into second semester. I already have a job opportunity coming up which will test me and I hope to
    learn a lot from. As for now, I am picking away at my dissertation, designing the UI and hope to sort that before next week. As for the first deliverable for my dissertation, I was awarded 75% for it, and I intend to maintain this at the end of second semester, and achieve a first for it.
  <h4> Dissertation deliverable 1 hand in </h4>
  <p> <i>Date posted: 23/11/2017 </i> <br> <br>
    After a tough few weeks I have completed the first draft of my dissertation and submitted it. If you would like to read it, it is available <a href="Dissertation_D1.pdf"> here </a>(downloads .pdf file).
  <h4> Picking a dissertation topic </h4>
  <p> <i>Date posted: 25/09/17</i> <br> <br>
  <p> For my fourth year dissertation <a  href="diss.html"> (more details here) </a> I have decided to investigate Personal Safety mobile applications and develop my own. This project includes a lot, including conducting a survey to determine if people find them useful and if so, what kind of features they expect from one. I will then begin to design my own app, implement it, test it, and evaluate if it is fit for purpose and if it improves personal safety of its users. I am incredibly excited to be taking part in this project and hope to learn a lot from it. </p>

<h4> Creating a blog </h4>
<p> <i>Date posted: 10/09/17</i> <br> <br>
<p> After months of procrastination, I've finally got around to creating this website, a development blog for all the projects I am currently a part of. For a list of projects click <a href="projects.html"> here </a>
