                    <p>Thanks to e-Placement, Time2Dine got invited to attend the ScotSoft conference at the EICC in Edinburgh. The conference was filled with very interesting talks and I learned a lot from each of them I attended. There was such
                    a variety of topics, so there was something for everyone. I attended talks ranging from technology in the health sector, to penetration testing, to the importance of Open Data and the rise of OpenStreetMaps. We were also
                    invited to attend the Awards Dinner, in which we'd be presented the e-Placement of the year award (which Time2Dine got awarded silver). The night was fantastic, and was topped off with a wonderful after dinner speech from the 2-time Gold Medallist Lizzy Yarnold. </p>

                    <p> I have now received my exam results for semester 1 of year 4. I achieved an A for my <a href="Reports/Dissertation_D1.pdf">first deliverable of my dissertation </a> and two B's in Data Mining and Machine Learning (62%) and Professional and Industrial Studies (65%). More details on these courses <a href="courses.html"> here</a>. However I am dissapointed in my grade for Data Visualisation (32%) as I prioritised other courses and dissertation over this which resulted in a much lower grade. Overall, I am happy with these results, as this was my first true challenge concerning time management within my time at university.</p>

                    <h4><b>About Me</b></h4>
                    <p>Hello, my name is Jamie McCulloch, and I am a fifth year student at Heriot Watt University. I am currently studying a Masters in Software Engineering with the intention of graduating in 2019. I am also undertaking a placement at Time2Dine, more details on that here
                    Now in my fifth year I have worked on a lot of projects within university (see here: projects) ranging from a currency converter Android application to using an A* search algorithm for robots to find their goals. While university has most definitely been challenging, I still have the same passion for computing and technology as I did when I changed the ink in a printer for the first time.

I have just finished a 6 month placement working as a software engineer at Time2Dine in Glasgow. I learned and then developed in Laravel, a PHP framework that has quickly become a favourite of mine through its Eloquent model to manipulate database records, and the simplicity of it all. I also delved into VueJS to make the
                        website reactive to different actions. More of this detailed <a href="placement.html">here</a> if interested. I also work in a local golf club/country club at the weekends, and have done so for around 3 years.
                        My online CV is available <a href="cv.html">here</a> if you would like to take a look.
                    For any enquiries my work related email is jmcculloch196@gmail(dot)com, I aim to be as responsive on this as possible and should reply within a few hours at most.</p>                </div>
